# MyPortfolio
This Repository displays my web portfolio. So far It uses basic Web Development skills such as HTML and CSS. It includes a responsive navigation bar with links that can direct users to Home, About and Contact pages. The Home page briefly introduces my name and skills with a button that can direct users to a list of project I have completed.
